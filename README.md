# Demented

This is a web-based game I made as a personal study in game design. 
The game is both visually and mechanically simple. However it becomes convoluted through each player's individual experiences, biases, and pre-conceptions. By relying on the player to overthink what they are presented with, something simple is able to present itself as complex.
